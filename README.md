# Video to Roboflow: Frame Extraction & Upload Tool

A self-hosted web utility to effortlessly extract high-quality frames from any video and upload them directly to your Roboflow projects. This tool streamlines the data annotation pipeline by bridging the gap between raw video footage and a ready-to-label dataset.

* **The Problem**: Manually scrubbing through videos, capturing screenshots, and uploading them one-by-one is tedious and inefficient.
* **The Solution**: This tool provides a unified interface to select precise video segments, choose the best frames, and upload them directly to Roboflow in organized batches.

| **üñºÔ∏è Frame-by-Frame Analysis** | Step through extracted frames one-by-one for careful inspection and selection.                                                                        |
| **üñ±Ô∏è Intuitive Selection** | Simply press the **spacebar** or click to select/deselect the perfect frames for your dataset. Selected frames are highlighted with a green border. |
| **ü§ñ Direct Roboflow Upload** | Securely connect to your Roboflow account to upload selected frames directly to your project and desired dataset split (train, valid, or test).      |
| **üóÇÔ∏è Organized Batches** | Assign a custom batch name for each upload job to keep your Roboflow datasets neatly organized.                                                          |
| **‚ö° Efficient Workflow** | A video processing queue lets you line up multiple videos and process them in a single, uninterrupted session.                                        |
| **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts** | Navigate (`‚Üê`, `‚Üí`), select (`Space`), and finish (`Enter`) with keyboard shortcuts for maximum efficiency.                                               |
| **üîí Self-Hosted & Secure** | Runs locally on your machine. Your videos and private Roboflow API keys are never exposed to external servers.                                         |
| **üì± Responsive UI** | A clean, modern interface that works beautifully on any screen size.                                                                                    |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `git` (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary Python libraries. Install them with a single command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository with the content you provided.)*

4.  **Run the Application**
    Launch the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will start, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

5.  **Open in Browser**
    Navigate to **<http://127.0.0.1:5000>** in your web browser to start using the tool.

## üîß How to Use the Application

The user interface is designed to be intuitive. For best results, follow this workflow:

1.  **Configure Roboflow (Required for Upload)**
    * Enter your **Roboflow Project URL** and **Private API Key**. Your key is treated like a password and stored only in your browser's local storage.
    * (Optional) Set a **Custom Batch Name**. If left empty, the video's filename is used.
    * Select the **Upload Split** (`train`, `valid`, or `test`).
    * Click **Save Configuration**. You can test the connection to ensure your credentials are correct.
    `[Image: Screenshot of the Roboflow configuration section]`

2.  **Add Videos to the Queue**
    * **From YouTube**: Paste a video URL and click **Add YouTube Video**.
    * **From Local File**: Click **Choose File**, select a video, and click **Upload File**.
    * Add as many videos as you need before processing.

3.  **Start Processing & Select a Segment**
    * Click **Start Processing** to load the first video.
    * On the timeline, drag the purple selection window and resize it to define your clip.
    * Click **Load Frames** to extract all frames from this segment.

4.  **Select Your Frames**
    * Navigate through the frames using the `‚Üê` and `‚Üí` arrow keys or the on-screen buttons.
    * Press the `Spacebar` or click **Toggle Selection** to select or deselect a frame.

5.  **Finish and Upload**
    * Once you're done selecting frames for a video, click **Finish This Video**.
    * Your selected frames will be uploaded directly to your configured Roboflow project.
    * The application will automatically load the next video in your queue.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

This tool is highly functional, but here are some potential features and improvements for the future:

* [ ] **Asynchronous Video Processing**: Implement a background worker queue for handling very large video files without blocking the UI.
* [ ] **Pre-Annotation with a Model**: Add an option to run a baseline model (e.g., YOLO) on frames and upload them with initial predictions.
* [ ] **Dockerization**: Provide a `Dockerfile` for easy, one-command deployment.
* [ ] **User Sessions**: Support multiple users or saving sessions to return to later.
* [ ] **Additional Export Options**: Allow saving frames with annotation metadata in formats like COCO or YOLO TXT.
